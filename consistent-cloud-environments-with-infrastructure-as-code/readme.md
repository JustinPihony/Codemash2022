## Abstract
Your SaaS app is doing great, but your cloud environment is growing more and more complex. After years of provisioning additional resources to keep it growing, nobody on the team remembers all of the dependencies anymore, and deployments are hitting snags because the development, testing, and production environments are inconsistent.

In this talk, you'll learn how to embrace Infrastructure as Code starting with Microsoft Azure. Together we'll create a robust Bicep script that can deploy to multiple environments, keeping them consistent. The days of your infrastructure being undocumented and inconsistent are over with a code-first, version-controlled method of managing cloud resources.
