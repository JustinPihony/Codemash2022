## Crafting an interpreted programming language in 60 minutes

Are you curious how programming languages are designed and implemented? Do you have nightmares about the “magic” that happens when you run/compile your code? Have you ever wanted to create your own programming language from scratch?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

In this session, you will learn the fundamentals of programming language design and will create and run an interpreted programming language called “Mash”. When this session is over, you will emerge a stronger software engineer and can say you had fun “Mash”-ing code at CodeMash.
