# Freaky Fast Full Stack with the FERN Stack
Can you code, build, and deploy a full-stack app with a web, iOS, and Android front-end in four hours? If it's possible, you'll at least have a fighting chance with the FERN stack: Firebase, Expo, and React Native. This fast-paced session will walk you through writing a messaging app front-end in React Native that uses Firebase for authentication, data storage, and API. Then we'll build and deploy the app to web, iOS, and Android in a flash with the help of Expo. Along the way, we'll meet some other tools that are great for fast prototyping of tri-platform apps, including React Navigation and MobX State Tree. This is a great session for anyone looking for shortcuts for their next hackathon project, as well as those interested in learning about any of the aforementioned technologies through realistic hands-on examples.
